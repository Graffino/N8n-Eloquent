# Laravel n8n Eloquent Integration

## Background and Motivation
This project aims to create a seamless integration between Laravel applications and n8n workflows. The integration consists of two parts:
1. A Laravel package that exposes Eloquent models to n8n
2. An n8n extension that allows the workflow platform to interact with Laravel's Eloquent models

The goal is to enable users to easily trigger n8n workflows from Laravel model events and allow n8n to read/write to Laravel models.

**CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: The current webhook subscription system uses Laravel's cache for persistence, which means all webhook subscriptions are lost when cache is cleared (server restarts, deployments, manual cache clearing). This is a production-blocking issue that requires immediate attention.

**NEW REQUIREMENTS**: 
1. Implement production-ready database persistence for webhook subscriptions
2. Enhance n8n nodes with dynamic dropdowns for model selection and field selection
3. Ensure robust subscription recovery and monitoring

## Example Workflow: User Creation & Counter Update

A key test workflow that demonstrates the integration will be:

1. When a new User model is created in Laravel (triggered by the `created` event)
2. n8n workflow is triggered with the User model data
3. Two actions are executed in n8n:
   - Send a welcome email using Mailgrid integration
   - Update a counter on another Laravel model called UserCounter

This workflow demonstrates both the event triggering from Laravel to n8n and the ability for n8n to update data back in Laravel.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Security** - Ensuring secure communication between Laravel and n8n with proper authentication
   - Will use API secret keys for authentication, matching n8n's common authentication patterns
   - HMAC signature verification for webhook calls to ensure data integrity

2. **Model Discovery** - Automatically discovering and exposing Laravel models
   - Scan all models in the default app/Models directory by default
   - Allow custom directory configuration in the package config

3. **Configurability** - Allowing granular control over which models and actions are exposed
   - Whitelist/blacklist approach for model exposure
   - Fine-grained configuration of allowed operations per model
   - Configuration of property getters/setters that can trigger events

4. **Bi-directional Communication** - Enabling both event triggering from Laravel and data manipulation from n8n
   - Support for standard Eloquent lifecycle events (created, updated, deleted, etc.)
   - Support for property getter/setter event triggering
   - Handling of database transactions between systems

5. **User Experience** - Making both the Laravel package and n8n extension intuitive to use
   - Simple setup process with sensible defaults
   - Clear error logging and debugging capabilities
   - Comprehensive documentation

5. Create webhook endpoints in Laravel
   - Success criteria: Secure endpoints that n8n can call to interact with models
