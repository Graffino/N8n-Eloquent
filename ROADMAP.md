## Integration Example

Here's an example of how these nodes could work together in a complete workflow:

1. User Registration Flow:
   - Listen for new user registrations (Event Listener Node)
   - Validate their data (Validation Node)
   - Process their profile picture (File Storage Node)
   - Send welcome email (Mail Node)
   - Queue background account setup (Job Dispatcher Node)
   - Cache user preferences (Cache Node)
   - Broadcast joining to dashboard (Broadcasting Node)

This roadmap represents our vision for expanding the n8n Laravel integration capabilities. Each node is designed to bring specific Laravel functionality into your n8n workflows, making it easier to build complex automation scenarios while leveraging Laravel's powerful features.
