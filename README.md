- **Health Monitoring**: Automatic subscription recovery and health status tracking
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed audit trails with n8n-specific tags for easy filtering
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling with automatic retry mechanisms
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient request handling with minimal overhead
- **Scalability**: Designed for high-volume webhook processing with concurrent support

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning

**SSL Certificate Validation**: This package allows connecting to non-SSL certificated APIs (HTTP) by skipping all certificate validations for development and testing purposes. However, **we strongly recommend against using public non-HTTPS websites in production environments**.

**Security Best Practices**:

- Always use HTTPS in production environments
- Ensure your Laravel application and n8n instance communicate over secure connections
- Regularly update your SSL certificates
- Consider using a reverse proxy (like nginx) with proper SSL termination
- Monitor your webhook endpoints for any suspicious activity

## üì¶ Installation

1. Install via composer:

```bash
composer require shortinc/n8n-eloquent
```

2. Install n8n nodes:

```bash
cd n8n-extension
npm install
npm run build
```

3. Configure your `.env`:

```env
N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/path
N8N_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Add the `HasWebhooks` trait to your model:

```php
use Shortinc\N8nEloquent\Traits\HasWebhooks;

class User extends Model
{
    use HasWebhooks;
    
    protected static $webhookEvents = [
        'created',
        'updated',
        'deleted'
    ];
}
```

2. Create a workflow in n8n:
   - Add the "Laravel Eloquent Trigger" node
   - Select your model and events
   - Connect to other nodes
   - Activate the workflow

3. Test the integration:

```php
User::create(['name' => 'Test User']); // Will trigger n8n workflow
```

### Event Listener Quick Start

1. Create a custom Laravel event:

```php
use Shortinc\N8nEloquent\Events\BaseEvent;

class UserRegistered extends BaseEvent
{
    public $user;
    
    public function __construct($user)
    {
        $this->user = $user;
    }
}
```

2. Create a workflow in n8n:
   - Add the "Laravel Event Listener" node
   - Select your custom event
   - Configure security settings
   - Connect to other nodes
   - Activate the workflow

3. Dispatch the event from Laravel:

```php
event(new UserRegistered($user)); // Will trigger n8n workflow
```

### Event Dispatcher Quick Start

1. Create a workflow in n8n:
   - Add the "Laravel Event Dispatcher" node
   - Select from available Laravel events
   - Configure event parameters
   - Connect to other nodes
   - Activate the workflow

2. Dispatch events from n8n workflows with full parameter validation and metadata tracking.

### Job Dispatcher Quick Start

1. Configure available jobs in `config/n8n-eloquent.php`:

```php
'jobs' => [
    'available' => [
        'App\\Jobs\\SendEmailJob',
        'App\\Jobs\\ProcessDataJob',
    ],
],
```

2. Create a workflow in n8n:
   - Add the "Laravel Job Dispatcher" node
   - Select from your configured jobs
   - Set parameters and queue options
   - Activate the workflow

3. Dispatch jobs from n8n workflows with full parameter validation and queue management.
